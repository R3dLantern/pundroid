# Pundroid
Pundroid is an Asteroids-based 2D space shooter made in Unity.

## Plot
In Pundroid, you pilot a little UFO on its journey through a dangerous asteroid field. With your trusty laser cannon, you can shoot your way through the asteroids arcade-style to get points. Some asteroids even reveal useful powerups.

## Where we go from here
We still develop the game and accept ideas and suggestions. While g1zeh's graphical creativity knows no end, I am still a beginner when it comes to Unity C# - but not for long.
